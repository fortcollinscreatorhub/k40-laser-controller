Issues to fix if we rev the PCB:
- Use a different footprint for mounting holes, with a larger gap in copper.
  This will prevent metal screws from contacting the copper fills.
  The current design requires the use of plastic washers or screws.
- Check LASER control transistor footprint; may want to use the variant with
  wider hole spacing.
- Consider inverting LED indicator on air assist signal, since the attached
  relay board inverts the signal.
